"""Tests for `src/calliope/solve.py`.

Exercises the public API of the equilibrium-atmosphere solver:
`equilibrium_atmosphere` (the conventional forward call with
user-supplied `fO2_shift_IW`) and `equilibrium_atmosphere_authoritative_O`
(the Path C inverse call with user-supplied `O_kg_total`).

`solve.py` is the largest CALLIOPE source file (>1200 LOC) and its
test surface is split across this file and several **topical
cross-cutting** files for readability:

- `tests/test_authoritative_O.py` and the two siblings
  (`test_authoritative_O_monotonicity.py`,
  `test_authoritative_O_validation.py`) cover the Path C entry
  point's contract, monotonicity properties, and input validation.
- `tests/test_equilibrium_paths.py` covers the forward solver's
  behaviour on multi-species compositions.
- `tests/test_partial_species.py` covers the partial-species (only-
  some-elements-included) branches.
- `tests/test_stoichiometry.py` covers stoichiometric ratios across
  the published reactions.
- `tests/test_targets.py` covers the target-element-budget
  computation that feeds both entry points.
- `tests/test_invariants.py` covers per-element / per-species
  closure invariants.
- `tests/test_invariants_hypothesis.py` covers the property-based
  fuzz tests at the slow tier.

This file is the **primary per-source test file** required by the
1:1 mirroring rule. It contains the reference-pinned anchor (round-
trip self-consistency at the Earth fiducial) plus a small set of
physics_invariant smoke tests that exercise both entry points.

See `.github/.claude/rules/calliope-tests.md` sections 1-3 and 12
for the anti-happy-path, discrimination-guard, physics-invariant,
and 1:1 mirroring rules.

    resulting O budget recover the original `fO2_shift_IW_derived`
    within 0.05 dex.

    Anchor type: cross-implementation cross-check. CALLIOPE implements
    two distinct entry points into the equilibrium-chemistry solver:

    - `equilibrium_atmosphere` (legacy): user supplies `fO2_shift_IW`,
      solver returns species kg.
    - `equilibrium_atmosphere_authoritative_O` (Path C): user supplies
      the target `O_kg_total`, solver inverts to find the `fO2_shift_IW`
      that matches it.

    The round-trip is the contract: feeding the forward-mode `O_kg_total`
    output into Path C must recover the original `fO2_shift_IW` within
    the documented solver tolerance.

    Discrimination guard: a regression that broke either the forward
    O mass-balance or the inverse bisection would lose the round-trip
    within 0.1 dex. The 0.05 dex envelope is half of that, so a
    coefficient-only bug would fail loudly.

    Hidden coupling: the pin uses the Earth-fiducial input
    (`T_magma = 1800 K`, `Phi = 1.0`, all volatile species included)
    with the default Fischer 2011 IW buffer.
